Hey Bill, to get GHC dumping G2 correctly a few things here are different.
You can always diff it against the "fresh download" to detect differences

  commit: ad62ae2c52fc44e0a88a24201c143a02560a4eca

All in all, very few GHC files were modified. Most of the additions were
shoving the right things into the compiler/g2 directory.

GHC side:
---------
  1. Modify compiler/ghc.cabal.in to depend on the G2 libraries are used
  2. Modify compiler/main/DriverPipeline.hs and
            compiler/main/PipelineMonad.hs to inject dumping cgguts

G2 side:
--------
  1. Download fresh copy of G2 into compiler/g2/G2.


Important things to note:
-------------------------
  1. In order to correctly snapshot everything with git, make sure that
      all the submodules DO NOT have their .git files.
  2. The sequence of commands to dump is to:
      
      ./boot
      ./configure
      make -j4

     Here I use -j4 because I have four cores I can use. You can drop
     the -j4 flag completely or use something else.
  3. The default dump location is /home/celery/Desktop/ghc-dump-dir,
     as can be seen in compiler/g2/G2.hs. This is also the primary file
     that acts as a bridge between GHC and G2, via the dumpG2 function.
